[1] In the beginning, a voice cried out in the wilderness, "Prepare the way!"
[2] A man named John, dressed in camel's hair and eating locusts and honey, emerged as a messenger.
[3] He baptized with water for repentance and spoke of one greater than he who would come.
[4] People from all around, confessing their sins, were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
[5] Among them came Jesus, the Son of God, and he was baptized by John.
[6] As Jesus emerged from the water, the heavens opened, and the Spirit descended like a dove.
[7] A voice from above declared, "You are my beloved Son; with you, I am well pleased."
[8] Immediately, the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by Satan for forty days.
[9] Afterward, Jesus began his ministry, proclaiming, "The kingdom of God is near; repent and believe in the good news!"
[10] He called fishermen by the sea, saying, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
[11] They left their nets and followed him.
[12] In Capernaum, Jesus taught with authority and cast out unclean spirits, and news of him spread quickly.
[13] He healed a leper, saying, "Be clean," and the leprosy left the man.
[14] Jesus continued to preach throughout Galilee, and crowds gathered to hear him.
[15] He declared, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."
[16] Passing by the Sea of Galilee, Jesus called James and John, who left their father Zebedee to follow him.
[17] On the Sabbath, Jesus entered the synagogue, and the people were astounded by his teaching.
[18] In the synagogue, a man with an unclean spirit cried out, but Jesus rebuked the spirit, and it left the man.
[19] News of Jesus' deeds spread like wildfire.
[20] That evening, people brought the sick and demon-possessed to Jesus, and he healed them all.
[21] Rising early, Jesus prayed in solitude, but his disciples found him and said, "Everyone is looking for you."
[22] Jesus replied, "Let us go to the nearby villages so I can preach there, too, for that is why I came."
[23] He traveled throughout Galilee, casting out demons and healing the afflicted.
[24] Once, a leper came to him, saying, "If you will, you can make me clean." Jesus, filled with compassion, touched him and said, "I will; be clean."
[25] Immediately, the leprosy vanished.
[26] Jesus sternly warned the man not to tell anyone but to show himself to the priest as a testimony.
[27] The man spread the news, and Jesus could no longer enter the city openly but stayed in desolate places.
[28] Still, people came to him from every quarter, seeking healing and solace.
[29] One day, four men brought a paralytic to Jesus, lowering him through the roof to be healed.
[30] Jesus forgave the man's sins and said, "Rise, take up your bed, and go home." The man did, to the amazement of all.
[31] Jesus dined with tax collectors and sinners, prompting questions from the religious leaders.
[32] He answered, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
[33] Jesus' disciples did not fast like the Pharisees but rejoiced, for he was with them.
[34] When challenged, Jesus taught about old wineskins and new wine, revealing the need for a fresh perspective.
[35] He withdrew to pray, and Simon and others sought him, saying, "Everyone is looking for you."
[36] Jesus replied, "Let us go to the next towns, for I must preach there also, for that is why I came out."
[37] So, he went throughout all Galilee, proclaiming the message in synagogues and casting out demons.
[38] He encountered a leper who implored, "If you will, you can make me clean." Jesus, moved with pity, touched him.
[39] Immediately, the leprosy left, and Jesus instructed the man to tell no one but to show himself to the priest as a testimony.
[40] The man's news spread, and Jesus stayed in desolate places, yet people came to him from all directions.
[41] Once, four men brought a paralyzed man, lowered him through the roof, and Jesus forgave his sins, healing him.
[42] The man arose, took his bed, and departed, leaving everyone amazed.
[43] Jesus dined with tax collectors and sinners, causing religious leaders to question him.
[44] He explained that the healthy have no need of a physician, but the sick do.
[45] Jesus' disciples did not fast like the Pharisees but rejoiced, for the bridegroom was with them.

[1] In a crowded house, news of Jesus spread, and many gathered to see him.
[2] Four men arrived, carrying a paralytic on a mat, seeking Jesus' healing touch.
[3] They couldn't enter due to the crowd, so they uncovered the roof and lowered the paralytic.
[4] Seeing their faith, Jesus said, "Your sins are forgiven."
[5] Scribes questioned, "Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
[6] Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, asked, "Which is easier, to say 'your sins are forgiven' or 'take up your bed and walk'?"
[7] He continued, "So that you may know, I say: 'Take up your bed and walk.'"
[8] The paralytic arose, took his bed, and walked, astonishing everyone.
[9] Later, Jesus called Levi, a tax collector, to follow him.
[10] Levi hosted a great feast, with Jesus, tax collectors, and sinners.
[11] Pharisees questioned his choice of company, and Jesus replied, "Healthy don't need a doctor, but the sick do."
[12] He came for the sinners, not the righteous.
[13] Disciples of John and Pharisees fasted, questioning why Jesus' disciples did not.
[14] Jesus said, "While the bridegroom is here, they won't fast. New wine in old wineskins would burst them."
[15] On the Sabbath, disciples picked grain, prompting Pharisees' criticism.
[16] Jesus reminded them of David's actions when hungry.
[17] He declared, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
[18] In the synagogue, a man with a withered hand awaited Jesus' healing.
[19] Pharisees observed, hoping to accuse him.
[20] Jesus asked, "Is it lawful to do good or harm on the Sabbath, to save life or kill?"
[21] They remained silent.
[22] Grieved by their hardness, Jesus healed the man.
[23] Pharisees plotted with Herodians to destroy Jesus.
[24] Jesus knew their schemes and withdrew, healing many.
[25] A woman with an issue of blood sought healing by touching his garment's fringe.
[26] Her faith made her well.
[27] Jairus, a synagogue ruler, asked Jesus to heal his dying daughter.
[28] On the way, the woman was healed.

[1] In a synagogue, a man with a withered hand stood,
    The Pharisees watched, hearts filled with ill.
    Would Jesus heal on the Sabbath, they pondered,
    To accuse Him, they waited, silent and still.

[2] Jesus said to the man, "Step forth and stand,"
    To those with hard hearts, His eyes scanned.
    "Is it lawful to do good or harm, on this day?
    To save life or kill?" He asked in His own way.

[3] They remained silent, with hearts so cold,
    In their rigid traditions, their faith was sold.
    Grieved by their hardness, He healed with love,
    The man with the withered hand, from above.

[4] Pharisees conspired with Herodians near,
    Seeking to destroy Him, filling the air with fear.
    Jesus withdrew, healing many in His grace,
    Yet their plotting continued, in that sacred place.

[5] A woman with an issue of blood drew near,
    Twelve long years, she'd suffered, full of fear.
    She touched His garment's fringe, in hope she'd find,
    Healing and solace for her troubled mind.

[6] Her faith made her well, her pain did cease,
    As Jesus declared, "Daughter, go in peace."
    Jairus, a ruler, approached in despair,
    His daughter was dying, needing Jesus' care.

[7] On the way to Jairus' home, they did go,
    The woman was healed, her faith on full show.
    Yet messengers arrived with a grievous tale,
    Jairus' daughter had died, hope seemed frail.

[8] Jesus said, "Only believe; do not weep.
    She's not dead but asleep." His promise to keep.
    He took her hand, and her spirit He'd restore,
    "Little girl, arise," and she breathed once more.

[9] Amazement filled all, they were struck with awe,
    At the miraculous power that Jesus saw.
    "Tell no one," He said, "keep this marvel hidden,"
    But His fame spread wide, His love unbidden.

[10] Jesus chose twelve, His apostles, with care,
     To be with Him, their burdens they'd share.
     He named them one by one, a sacred call,
     To preach, heal, and cast out demons, all.

[11] Scribes accused Him, saying, "He's gone astray,
     By Beelzebul's power, He casts demons away."
     Jesus refuted, a kingdom divided can't stand,
     Satan against Satan, it's not what He'd planned.

[12] He spoke of blasphemy, a grave, soulful sin,
     But blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, within,
     Would never be forgiven, a warning severe,
     Those who reject grace would be bound in fear.

[13] His mother and brothers outside did wait,
     Seeking to see Him, at the door, they'd state,
     "Who are My mother and brothers?" Jesus asked,
     "Those who do God's will, their faith steadfast."

[14] In parables, He taught the crowds so vast,
     Using stories of sowers, seeds, and a cast.
     The mysteries of the kingdom, He did share,
     To those with ears to hear, His truth laid bare.

[15] To His disciples, the secrets He'd unveil,
     The kingdom's inner workings, they'd inhale.
     He calmed a stormy sea, showing His might,
     "Peace, be still," He said, bringing calm and light.

[16] Yet the people marveled, their doubts remained,
     Who is this Jesus, with mysteries unchained?
     For demons, He cast out, the sick He'd mend,
     Their Messiah, a mystery, from beginning to end.

[17] Jesus crossed the sea, to Gadarenes' shore,
     A man possessed by demons, his torment tore.
     He lived among the tombs, bound by despair,
     Jesus freed him from chains, in answer to prayer.

[18] The demons begged not to be sent to the abyss,
     Into a nearby herd of swine, they wished to dismiss.
     The swine rushed into the sea, a violent dive,
     The man, now set free, wished with Jesus to thrive.

[19] But the people of Gadara, filled with fright,
     Asked Jesus to leave, His presence out of sight.
     The healed man proclaimed His wondrous grace,
     Returning to his town, a transformed embrace.

[20] Jesus departed, and a crowd gathered round,
     A synagogue ruler, Jairus, was tightly bound.
     "My daughter's near death, please come with haste,"
     His plea for help, in Jesus' presence placed.

[21] Along the way, a woman with faith came near,
     She'd been bleeding for years, her soul gripped by fear.
     She touched Jesus' cloak, His power did flow,
     "Daughter, your faith has made you whole," He'd bestow.

[22] While He still spoke, messengers brought news,
     Jairus' daughter had died, and faith they'd lose.
     Jesus comforted, "Only believe," He'd say,
     In her home, He'd bring life, darkness He'd sway.

[23] They arrived at the house, weeping filled the air,
     "The child is asleep," Jesus said, His words fair.
     He took her hand, spoke tenderly, and she'd rise,
     Her life was restored, to her parents' surprise.

[24] News of these miracles spread far and wide,
     Jesus' power to heal and restore couldn't hide.
     Blind eyes opened, the mute began to speak,
     The deaf could hear, the crippled found their peak.

[25] Pharisees, however, held darkening views,
     They accused Him of demon powers, in their abuse.
     "By the prince of demons," they claimed, filled with spite,
     "He casts out demons," their misguided fight.

[26] Jesus responded wisely, their logic undone,
     "A kingdom divided cannot be overrun."
     He cast out demons by God's Spirit within,
     His kingdom was rising, defeating darkness and sin.

[27] His true family was those who did His Father's will,
     In God's kingdom, their hearts He'd fulfill.
     In parables, He shared truths, deep and profound,
     To those with receptive hearts, His grace unbound.

[28] "The sower sows the word," Jesus did explain,
     The seed on good soil would not be in vain.
     Thirty, sixty, a hundredfold they'd yield,
     Hearts transformed by God's grace, in Him, they'd be sealed.

[29] "A lamp under a basket is not concealed,
     It's set on a stand, its light revealed.
     Pay attention to what you hear, for it's true,
     The measure you give will return to you."

[30] With parables and wisdom, Jesus would teach,
     On a stormy sea, He'd calm and still reach.
     In Gadara, demons He'd cast out and save,
     With faith, He'd heal, and lives He'd engrave.

[31] Amidst rejection and doubt, His mission was clear,
     To bring God's kingdom, to all who'd draw near.
     His power over darkness, His grace without end,
     In Mark's gospel, Jesus, our Savior and Friend.

[1] Again he began to teach beside the sea. And a very large crowd gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land.

[2] And he taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them:
[3] "Listen! A sower went out to sow.
[4] And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.
[5] Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil;
[6] and when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away.
[7] Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.
[8] And other seeds fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold."
[9] And he said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."

[10] And when he was alone, those who were about him with the twelve asked him concerning the parables.

[11] And he said to them, "To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables;
[12] so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand; lest they should turn again, and be forgiven."
[13] And he said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?
[14] The sower sows the word.
[15] And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown; when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which is sown in them.
[16] And these in like manner are the ones sown upon rocky ground, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;
[17] and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.
[18] And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word,
[19] but the cares of the world, and the delight in riches, and the desire for other things, enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.
[20] But those that were sown upon the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold."
[21] And he said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed, and not on a stand?

[22] For there is nothing hid, except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret, except to come to light.
[23] If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."
[24] And he said to them, "Take heed what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get, and still more will be given you.
[25] For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away."
[26] And he said, "The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed upon the ground,
[27] and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he knows not how.
[28] The earth produces of itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
[29] But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come."
[30] And he said, "With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?

[31] It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth;
[32] yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade."
[33] With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it;
[34] he did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.
[35] On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side."
[36] And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him.
[37] And a great storm of wind arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already filling.
[38] But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care if we perish?"
[39] And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
[40] He said to them, "Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?"
[41] And they were filled with awe, and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even wind and sea obey him?"

[1] And when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Beth'phage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,

[1] And he began to speak to them in parables. "A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge around it, and dug a pit for the wine press, and built a tower, and let it out to tenants, and went into another country.
[2] When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.
[3] And they took him and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
[4] Again he sent to them another servant, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully.
[5] And he sent another, and him they killed; and so with many others, some they beat and some they killed.
[6] He had still one other, a beloved son; finally he sent him to them, saying, `They will respect my son.'
[7] But those tenants said to one another, `This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'
[8] And they took him and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
[9] What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants, and give the vineyard to others.
[10] Have you not read this scripture: `The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; [11] this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
[12] And they tried to arrest him, but feared the multitude, for they perceived that he had told the parable against them; so they left him and went away.
[13] And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Hero'di-ans, to entrap him in his talk.
[14] And they came and said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are true, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
[15] Should we pay them, or should we not?" But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, "Why put me to the test? Bring me a coin, and let me look at it."
[16] And they brought one. And he said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" They said to him, "Caesar's."
[17] Jesus said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." And they were amazed at him.
[18] And Sad'ducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him a question, saying,
[19] "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man must take the wife, and raise up children for his brother.
[20] There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no children;
[21] and the second took her, and died, leaving no children; and the third likewise;
[22] and the seven left no children. Last of all the woman also died.
[23] In the resurrection whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife."
[24] Jesus said to them, "Is not this why you are wrong, that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God?
[25] For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
[26] And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, `I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
[27] He is not God of the dead, but of the living; you are quite wrong."
[28] And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, "Which commandment is the first of all?"
[29] Jesus answered, "The first is, `Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one;
[30] and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.'
[31] The second is this, `You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."
[32] And the scribe said to him, "You are right, Teacher; you have truly said that he is one, and there is no other but he;
[33] and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
[34] And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And after that no one dared to ask him any question.
[35] And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, "How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
[36] David himself, inspired by the Holy Spirit, declared, `The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I put thy enemies under thy feet.'
[37] David himself calls him Lord; so how is he his son?" And the great throng heard him gladly.
[38] And in his teaching he said, "Beware of the scribes, who like to go about in long robes, and to have salutations in the market places
[39] and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,
[40] who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation."
[41] And he sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the multitude putting money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums.
[42] And a poor widow came, and put in two copper coins, which make a penny.
[43] And he called his disciples to him, and said to them, "Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury.
[44] For they all contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, her whole living."

[1] And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!"
[2] And Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down."
[3] And as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
[4] "Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign when these things are all to be accomplished?"
[5] And Jesus began to say to them, "Take heed that no one leads you astray.
[6] Many will come in my name, saying, `I am he!' and they will lead many astray.
[7] And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; this must take place, but the end is not yet.
[8] For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places, there will be famines; this is but the beginning of the birth-pangs.
[9] "But take heed to yourselves; for they will deliver you up to councils; and you will be beaten in synagogues; and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, to bear testimony before them.
[10] And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.
[11] And when they bring you to trial and deliver you up, do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say; but say whatever is given you in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.
[12] And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death;
[13] and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.
[14] "But when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains;
[15] let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter his house, to take anything away;
[16] and let him who is in the field not turn back to take his mantle.
[17] And alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days!
[18] Pray that it may not happen in winter.
[19] For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.
[20] And if the Lord had not shortened the days, no human being would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened the days.
[21] And then if any one says to you, `Look, here is the Christ!' or `Look, there he is!' do not believe it.
[22] False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect.
[23] But take heed; I have told you all things beforehand.
[24] "But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,
[25] and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.
[26] And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
[27] And then he will send out the angels, and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.
[28] "From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.
[29] So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates.
[30] Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away before all these things take place.
[31] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
[32] "But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
[33] Take heed, watch; for you do not know when the time will come.
[34] It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch.
[35] Watch therefore -- for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or in the morning --
[36] lest he come suddenly and find you asleep.
[37] And what I say to you I say to all: Watch."

[1] It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth, and kill him;
[2] for they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be a tumult of the people."
[3] And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head.
[4] But there were some who said to themselves indignantly, "Why was the ointment thus wasted?
[5] For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor." And they reproached her.
[6] But Jesus said, "Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
[7] For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you will, you can do good to them; but you will not always have me.
[8] She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burying.
[9] And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her."
[10] Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them.
[11] And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him.
[12] And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the passover lamb, his disciples said to him, "Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the passover?"
[13] And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him,
[14] and wherever he enters, say to the householder, `The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?'
[15] And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us."
[16] And the disciples set out and went to the city, and found it as he had told them; and they prepared the passover.
[17] And when it was evening he came with the twelve.
[18] And as they were at table eating, Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me."
[19] They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one after another, "Is it I?"
[20] He said to them, "It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me.
[21] For the Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."
[22] And as they were eating, he took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, "Take; this is my body."
[23] And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it.
[24] And he said to them, "This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.
[25] Truly, I say to you, I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
[26] And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
[27] And Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away; for it is written, `I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'
[28] But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."
[29] Peter said to him, "Even though they all fall away, I will not."
[30] And Jesus said to him, "Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times."
[31] But he said vehemently, "If I must die with you, I will not deny you." And they all said the same.
[32] And they went to a place which was called Gethsem'ane; and he said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I pray."
[33] And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled.
[34] And he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch."
[35] And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
[36] And he said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what thou wilt."
[37] And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?
[38] Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
[39] And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.
[40] And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer him.
[41] And he came the third time, and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
[42] Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand."
[43] And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
[44] Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away under guard."
[45] And when he came, he went up to him at once, and said, "Master!" And he kissed him.
[46] And they laid hands on him and seized him.
[47] But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.
[48] And Jesus said to them, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?
[49] Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled."
[50] And they all forsook him, and fled.
[51] And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body; and they seized him,
[52] but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.
[53] And they led Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled.
[54] And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, and warming himself at the fire.
[55] Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but they found none.
[56] For many bore false witness against him, and their witness did not agree.
[57] And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,
[58] "We heard him say, `I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.'"
[59] Yet not even so did their testimony agree.
[60] And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?"
[61] But he was silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
[62] And Jesus said, "I am; and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."
[63] And the high priest tore his garments, and said, "Why do we still need witnesses?
[64] You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?" And they all condemned him as deserving death.
[65] And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him, saying to him, "Prophesy!" And the guards received him with blows.
[66] And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the high priest came;
[67] and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, "You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus."
[68] But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you mean." And he went out into the gateway.
[69] And the maid saw him, and began again to say to the bystanders, "This man is one of them."
[70] But again he denied it. And after a little while again the bystanders said to Peter, "Certainly you are one of them; for you are a Galilean."
[71] But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not know this man of whom you speak."
[72] And immediately the cock crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, "Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times." And he broke down and wept.

[1] And as soon as it was morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council held a consultation; and they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him to Pilate.
[2] And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he answered him, "You have said so."
[3] And the chief priests accused him of many things.
[4] And Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you."
[5] But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate wondered.
[6] Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked.
[7] And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barab'bas.
[8] And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he was wont to do for them.
[9] And he answered them, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"
[10] For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up.
[11] But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barab'bas instead.
[12] And Pilate again said to them, "Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?"
[13] And they cried out again, "Crucify him."
[14] And Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him."
[15] So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barab'bas; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
[16] And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the praetorium); and they called together the whole battalion.
[17] And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on him.
[18] And they began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
[19] And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and they knelt down in homage to him.
[20] And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak, and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him.
[21] And they compelled a passer-by, Simon of Cyre'ne, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.
[22] And they brought him to the place called Gol'gotha (which means the place of a skull).
[23] And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh; but he did not take it.
[24] And they crucified him, and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.
[25] And it was the third hour, when they crucified him.
[26] And the inscription of the charge against him read, "The King of the Jews."
[27] And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.
[29] And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself, and come down from the cross!"
[30] So also the chief priests mocked him to one another with the scribes, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself.
[32] Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.
[33] And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
[34] And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "E'lo-i, E'lo-i, la'ma sabach-tha'ni?" which means, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[35] And some of the bystanders hearing it said, "Behold, he is calling Eli'jah."
[36] And one ran and, filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Eli'jah will come to take him down."
[37] And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed his last.
[38] And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.
[39] And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that he thus breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"
[40] There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Mag'dalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salo'me,
[41] who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him; and also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
[42] And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
[43] Joseph of Arimathe'a, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
[44] And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
[45] And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph.
[46] And he bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
[47] Mary Mag'dalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

[1] And when the sabbath was past, Mary Mag'dalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salo'me, bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.
[2] And very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb when the sun had risen.
[3] And they were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?"
[4] And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back; -- it was very large.
[5] And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were amazed.
[6] And he said to them, "Do not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen, he is not here; see the place where they laid him.
[7] But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you."
[8] And they went out and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.
[9] Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.
[10] She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
[11] But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.
[12] After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.
[13] And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.
[14] Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at table; and he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.
[15] And he said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation.
[16] He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.
[17] And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
[18] they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover."
[19] So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.
[20] And they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it. Amen.
